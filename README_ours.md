# Usage

This section of the README walks through how to train and sample from a model.

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to it in your terminal. Then run:

```
pip install -e .
```

This should install the `improved_diffusion` python package that the scripts depend on. 

## Train

```
bash train.sh
```

## Sampling
```
bash sample.sh
```

You can adjust parameters in train.sh and sample.sh but mostly likely you don't need to.
